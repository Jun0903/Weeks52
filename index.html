            <b>My history</b>: I graduated from a high school in Seoul in
            2015.<br />
            After that, I entered the university and studied for 2 years, but I
            took a leave of absence several times becuase the department was not
            suitable for my aptitude.<br />
            Mean time, Korean adults had to serve in the military for 2 years,
            so I worked hard in the military.<br />
            After being discharged from the military, I studied English in Korea
            for a year and left to Canada.
